### Accomplishment of Criteria
Where could the concepts discussed in class be seen in your website?

- This include UI design to be responsive, which adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures that users have a consistent and optimal experience regardless of the device they are using. It includes intuitive navigation elements such as tabs, buttons, and gestures that allow users to easily navigate between different sections of the app, such as the home to explore page and profile. In feedback and interaction, UI provides visual feedback to users when performing actions such as liking a post and following a user. Our website's database stores user profiles, including information such as usernames, profile pictures, and bios. In summary, our website demonstrates the application of web systems concepts that we've discussed about UI design and database management, showcasing the importance of usability, responsiveness, and accessibility.

What was your inspiration for the design of the website?

- Our inspiration for our social media website, is that we based on some of the well-known social media sites, such as Twitter, or rather known as X, Facebook and Instagram. We based the layout from them, because apparently, they look aesthetically pleasing, especially with the white background.

What was your approach in creating the content of the website?
- The approach we took in creating our website was to develop a platform focused on simplicity and visual storytelling by posting things that users would like to post and let people who follow them see it since our goal was to allow users to share photos and videos easily. Overall, our approach prioritized user experience, creativity, and community engagement.

How is your website creative?
- Our name for the social media site is called, “Mingle”, and it starts with the name M. Since the word “Mingle” is like a synonym of the word “socialize”, the logo looks like two people being connected to each other, in which that is what the site is all about. The colors that we associated with our website are blue and yellow. Blue may signify peace and tranquil, while yellow may symbolize happiness, which our site indicates.

What did you use to deploy your website?
- We used images, CSS files, and Javascript in deploying our website to deliver static content closer to users, reducing latency and improving load times. Our website likely uses monitoring and logging tools to track the performance, availability, and security of its website and backend systems.
 
### How we worked as a team to accomplish the project

How did you divide the tasks between the team, and what is the responsibility of each one?
- Throughout the project, our team talked about each assignment with a plan of action. We separated the scope of work into manageable tasks and allocated each member to a specialized area where they could put their talents and knowledge to the best use. We made joint efforts to collaborate and support one another, offering help whenever needed. Our collaboration enabled us to function efficiently and assured that the final product was a shared success.

How did you prevent your changes in code from conflicting with each other?
- Preventing conflicts in code modifications is critical and helpful for our smooth development process. To avoid conflicts in our code changes, we prioritize communication and collaboration among team members. We ensure that everyone is updated on progress made and discuss any tasks that need attention. This helps us to stay organized and work cohesively towards our goals. By keeping each other informed, we can easily identify and resolve any potential issues. This approach allows us to maintain a smooth and efficient workflow.

### How we could improve your website in the future
- To enhance our website, we can refine both its design and layout to ensure they are visually appealing and intuitive for our users. Additionally, we must address any flaws or bugs present in the underlying code, which could be detected by both our users and testers during their interactions with the platform.
### Other thoughts that might be noteworthy
- When working on projects, time management is a crucial element to ensure that tasks are completed efficiently and effectively. Communication is equally important, as it helps to ensure that all members can share their thoughts equally to generate a better output. Scope management is another key factor, as it is necessary to ensure that the project remains within the designated parameters and that any changes are approved by each team member. 

- Despite the stress that often accompanies project development, it is important to maintain a sense of fun and enjoyment throughout the process. Always keep in mind that these projects are opportunities for learning and growth, that the skills and experience gained will be valuable assets for future projects. Staying motivated and focused on the end goal is crucial, and taking the time to reflect on the progress made can help to maintain momentum and keep team members engaged and invested in the project's success.
